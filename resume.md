Projects \& Publications
--------
Amazon Web Services
:   Designed secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant automation platform using AWS Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Queue Service, Relational Database Service, and Virtual Private Cloud. Wrote all system software and unit tests using Ruby-on-Rails, Sinatra, and RSpec.

Docker
:   Published [*the Containerized Jupyter Platform*](https://leanpub.com/thecontainerizedjupyterplatform/) on using Docker to build a distributed data science platform.

Heroku
:   Designed basic API Response server using Heroku's free service. Wrote all system  [software](https://github.com/joshuacook/echo_server).

numpy/scipy
:   Presented poster titled [*Applications of Imaginary Time Propagation Method in Material Research*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gz7xc0p2vc2vx4j/20141112-nsf_prem.pdf?dl=0) on my computational research in Dr. Eloranta's lab and how it intersects with lab work around liquid-to-liquid phase change caused by quantum effects unique to low temperature Helium.
:   Published [*The Zernike Polynomials*](https://leanpub.com/thezernikepolynomials/) a short paper proving various assertions and describing a simple system built in Python for generating 2D and 3D plots.

scikit-learn
:   Completed various projects ([1](https://github.com/joshuacook/titanic_survival_exploration),  [2](https://github.com/joshuacook/boston_housing_data_model_development),  [3](https://github.com/joshuacook/student_intervention)) for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. Expect to complete program in June of 2016.
